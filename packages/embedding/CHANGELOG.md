# @cavemem/embedding

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 416957b: Wire embeddings end-to-end and make lifecycle obvious.

  **Embeddings (previously dead code) now work out of the box**

  - New `@cavemem/embedding` package exports `createEmbedder(settings)` with three providers: `local` (Transformers.js, default — `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384 dim), `ollama`, and `openai`. `@xenova/transformers` is an optional dependency: installs automatically with `npm install -g cavemem` on supported platforms, falls back gracefully otherwise.
  - The worker now runs an embedding backfill loop: polls `observationsMissingEmbeddings`, embeds the expanded (human-readable) text, persists. On startup it drops rows whose model differs from settings so switching providers never pollutes cosine ranking.
  - Storage gains a model/dim filter on `allEmbeddings()` plus `dropEmbeddingsWhereModelNot`, `countObservations`, `countEmbeddings`, and a model-scoped variant of `observationsMissingEmbeddings`.
  - The `Embedder` interface in `@cavemem/core` now exposes `model` and `dim` so the store can reject mismatched rows before cosine computation.
  - Both the CLI `search` command and the MCP `search` tool instantiate the embedder lazily and pass it into `MemoryStore.search`. Semantic search is on by default; `cavemem search --no-semantic` bypasses it.
  - Worker writes a `worker.state.json` snapshot after every batch so `cavemem status` can show "embedded 124 / 200 (62%)" without hitting HTTP.

  **Lifecycle (previously unclear) is now ergonomic**

  - Hooks auto-spawn the worker detached + pidfile-guarded when it is not running (fast path < 2 ms; full `stat` + `process.kill(pid, 0)` probe). Respects `CAVEMEM_NO_AUTOSTART` for deterministic tests. Skipped when `embedding.autoStart=false` or `provider=none`.
  - Worker idle-exits after `embedding.idleShutdownMs` (default 10 min) of no embed work and no viewer traffic. No launchd/systemd integration needed.
  - New top-level `cavemem start`, `cavemem stop`, `cavemem restart`, and `cavemem viewer` commands — thin wrappers around the existing pidfile-managing implementation.

  **Config UX**

  - New `cavemem status` top-level command: single-pane dashboard showing settings path, data dir, DB counts, installed IDEs, embedding provider/model, backfill progress, worker pid and uptime.
  - New `cavemem config show|get|set|open|path|reset` command backed by zod `.describe()` — the schema is self-documenting; no parallel docs to maintain.
  - New `settingsDocs()` export from `@cavemem/config` returns `[{path, type, default, description}]` for every field.
  - `cavemem install` now prints a multi-line "what to try next" block explaining that there is no daemon to start, and surfaces the embedding model + weight-download cost.
  - Settings schema gains `embedding.batchSize`, `embedding.autoStart`, and `embedding.idleShutdownMs` — every field now has a `.describe(...)` string.

  **MCP server**

  - Lazy-singleton embedder resolution — MCP handshake stays fast; model loads on first `search` tool call.
  - New `list_sessions` tool.

  **Non-negotiable rule update**

  - CLAUDE.md now documents the "no daemon on the write path" invariant: hooks may detach-spawn the worker but must never wait on it; observations write synchronously.
